# A remark on the c-monotnonicity of optimal transport with capacity constraints
The following is an abstract of my paper: "A remark on the c-monotnonicity of optimal transport with capacity constraints". (To Submit)

Abstract: This paper studies the geometry of the optimizer for optimal transport with capacity constraints problem (capacity OT). We introduce the c-capacity monotonicity for capacity OT, which is a generalization of c-cyclical monotonicity in optimal transport.  We show that the optimizer of capacity OT is c-capacity monotone.
